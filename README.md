# Library Management System Assignment

## This project is to test students understanding so far on encapsulation, classes, objects and core java


## Objective
Develop a Java program to simulate basic operations in a library management system, focusing on object-oriented programming principles like classes, objects, encapsulation, and constructors.

## Requirements
- Implement the `Book`, `Library`, and `Patron` classes with the specified attributes and methods.
- Ensure proper use of encapsulation.
- Use constructors for initializing objects.
- Simulate operations in the `Main` class.
- LMS/app/src/test/java/org/example/ that will be your working file. There already exist a book class. Don't touch the test file.


## Testing
Ensure your program passes all tests by running the included test suite.

## Submission
Push your final changes to your GitHub repository and make sure your latest commit is before the deadline.

## Good luck - Joe!
